# `universal-service-rs`

The `universal-service` crate provides building blocks for creating service binaries across operating system platforms.

# Example

See `examples/service.rs` for a fully functional demo service:

```
cargo build --example service
```

On Windows, you can demonstrate the native Windows Service integration by running (as Administrator):

```
.\example-service-test.ps1
```
